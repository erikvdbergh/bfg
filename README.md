# bfg
BFG For Genomics tool package

Tools:
- seqc - count sequences, nucleotides
- sgrep - find sequences by name
- subseq - get subsequence
- revcomp - reverse complement a sequence (planned)

Goals:
- KISS design (No dependencies, one function per tool)
- command line and pipe friendly
- Open source (GPLv2)
- Fast (written in C, optimized for huge files, low memory where possible)
